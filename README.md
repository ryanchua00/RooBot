# RooBot

Roobot is a telegram bot that pings users for daily updates for your favourite pets!
This bot is named after my dog, Roody, and was created due to me being away on an exchange ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬/ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´. And at the request of my girlfriend.

## Aims

1. Daily alert at preset timing to ask for new pictures

## How it works

1. Github Actions cron job, to run at specified times, triggering telegram sendMessage API

## Plans

-   [x] Bot added into a channel
-   [x] Bot's message every 10am SGT

### Possible extensions:
**Pick a Poods!**
1. Webhook to Vercel functions
2. GET random roody photo from google drive
3. POST link to bot
